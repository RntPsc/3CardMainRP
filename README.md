## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me to reinforce my flexbox knowledge, as well as thinking responsively and using media-queries. It's also the first time I've used CSS variables for colors, and I've found it pretty neat and effective.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning responsive layout, and in next projects I will try to switch from flexbox to grid to have some practice with that.
